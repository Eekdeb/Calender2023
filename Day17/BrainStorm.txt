Starting att top left give value to next space. Then take the smallest value and continue from that point.
Example
Step1   Step2   Step3   Step4   Step5   Step6   Step7
X4--    X4--    X45-    X458    X458    X458    X458
3---    35--    35--    356-    356(11) 356(11) 356(11)
----    6---    6---    6---    6-(11)- 67(11)- 67(11)(16)

Then the answer is 16.
For the additional rule that you cant move straight for more than 3 we can have a counter that tells how many
moves are done in one direction.


When just adding the rule some paths are missed becouse it is posible to make a more expensive
step to get less expensive in the future.

To negate this a offsett can be sett so that you can take an unoptimal rout in but still test if
it it better in the future. The problem is it takes way more time to do so.

To minimize time los instead of sorting the list every time have a sorted list and add new items
sorted. But it is not enough. 

There are to many nodes to search so maybe if you can take away some nodes then the code
would be much faster. But how to take away only those that are not needed.

I tested to take away all the biggest numbers after a sertain time but that is not good because
all numbers grow and the biggest will be the smallest eventually.

I will test to take away the one with the least amount of steps after some time.
It is posable to take away the best outcome but i think that is in special cases and
this can be used in most cases. Lets try. Problem with this is that it does not know where 
to go so it can travel up and down and around and will be rewarded for this and not be removed.
